<h1>Privacy Policy -- “Ask for Help”</h1>

<p>This privacy policy is to help make sure our users are comfortable with our app and understand how their data is used.</p>


<h2>Information collection and use</h2>

<p>None of the information our app collects leaves your phone. It is all stored locally on your device. The app uses the information it collects to create a text message to the people you select and, if you want, it also gets your location to put in the text message. We (the developers) have access to none of that information.</p>

<h2>Information shared with others</h2>

<p>The app will share the text message you create, and optionally your location, with the contacts you select, similar to other messaging apps. The actual data is transmitted with your native messaging app.</p>

<h2>Contacting us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us uaskforhelp@gmail.com</p>
